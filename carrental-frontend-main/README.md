## API Integration

This frontend is designed to connect with a backend REST API. By default, API endpoints can be configured in the `src/services/` or within environment files (e.g., `.env`).

- Set the backend API URL in `.env`:
  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
  ```

- Update API service files if needed to match your backend's structure.
